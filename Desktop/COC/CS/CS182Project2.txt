Create 1 project with 1 main method
Add 4 recursive methods to your program. For each method have the main method ask for user 
input and then call the rucursive method, passing it the parameter(s) needed as input to the method. 
Here are the 4 recursive methods:



Exercise #4 Page 189 sumInts(begin,end) no global variables allowed
-enter 2 ints, first one smaller
call recursive method 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 ... sum of int 5 to 9 ---- 35
" Given two integers start and end, where end is greater than start, 
write a recursive Java method that returns the sum of the integers from start through end, inclusive. "


Exercise #8 Page 190 Method minChar, no global variables allowed
enter a string _________ -- make all upper or all lowercase
call recursive method
smallest char is 9
" Write a method called minChar that returns the minimum character (using the ASCII collating sequence) 
in a given string. So for example, minChar("hello") returns 'e'. "


Programming Problem #1 Page 195 Nonoverlapping occurances of a substring
"Write a recursive method that counts the number of nonoverlapping occurrences of a substring in a given string."


Programming Problem #2 Page 195 Double Your Pay, Everyday! Format answer in dollars and cents e.g. $ddd.cc
"enter the number of days: (1-31)"
"you have been offered a one month job that pays as follows: on the first day of the month, you are paid 
1 cent.  On the second day, 2 cents, on the third, 4 cents, and so forth, the amount doubles every day.  
Write a recursive method that, given the day number, computes the amount of money paid that day.  
Would you want this job? "
